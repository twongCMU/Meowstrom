# Meowstrom
A game where the objective is to herd cats using a laser pointer. Click and hold the left mouse button to shine the laser. Get all of the cats into the blue square and win! Try the game here: http://polynomial.org/game/

Features:
   * Cats following laser pointers and each other
   * Different classes of cats: regular, small energetic kitten, slower fat cat
   * Cats have varying stamina, speed, and acceleration
   * Mazes are randomly generated
   
This was my first time using Unity3D and C#. Since I didn't really know what I was doing, the code is not very clean. However I was able to get it to work and also use the object oriented nature of C# to simplify the different classes of cats.
